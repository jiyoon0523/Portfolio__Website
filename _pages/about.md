# G'day! I'm 지윤(Jiyoon).
### XR developer who just graduated with an anthropology degree. Aspires to be part of creating a world, striving to make it a good one.😉

I've been using Unity and C# to develop things that will enrich our real life or lead us into surreal adventures. Getting armoured to build a 'good' virtual reality when the era of VR comes.

When I don't work with codes I think, talk, and write about ethics, Earth, XR, and anthropology. If you're interested in my attempt to reconcile XR and planatary love, go check out my *brunch* !

Based in Seoul, South Korea. (No, I'm not Aussie- just a big fan of the fascinating continent.)
